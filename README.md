Conventions plugins for common things we need in our gradle projects (ex. configuring Kotlin, using NMS, publishing packages.) 

Note: currently this project is meant to be used via [Idofront](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Idofront) as it needs a version catalog called `idofrontLibs` in the project for part of the configuration.
